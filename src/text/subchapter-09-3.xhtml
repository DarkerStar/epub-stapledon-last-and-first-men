</h3>
<p>
	So contagious and so lethal was the new bacterium, that its authors expected the human race to be wiped out as completely as the Martian colony.
	Each dying remnant of humanity, isolated from its fellows by the breakdown of communications, imagined its own last moments to be the last of man.
	But by accident, almost one might say by miracle, a spark of human life was once more preserved, to hand on the sacred fire.
	A certain stock or strain of the race, promiscuously scattered throughout the continents, proved less susceptible than the majority.
	And, as the bacterium was less vigorous in a hot climate, a few of these favoured individuals, who happened to be in the tropical jungle, recovered from the infection.
	And of these few a minority recovered also from the pulmonary plague which, as usual, was propagated from the dead Martians.
</p>
<p>
	It might have been expected that from this human germ a new civilized community would have soon arisen.
	With such brilliant beings as the Second Men, surely a few generations, or at the most a few thousand years, should have sufficed to make up the lost ground.
</p>
<p>
	But no.
	Once more it was in a manner the very excellence of the species that prevented its recovery, and flung the spirit of Earth into a trance which lasted longer than the whole previous career of mammals.
	Again and again, some thirty million times, the seasons were repeated; and throughout this period man remained as fixed in bodily and mental character as, formerly, the platypus.
	Members of the earlier human species must find it difficult to understand this prolonged impotence of a race far more developed than themselves.
	For here apparently were both the requisites of progressive culture, namely a world rich and unpossessed, and a race exceptionally able.
	Yet nothing was done.
</p>
<p>
	When the plagues, and all the immense consequent putrefactions, had worked themselves off, the few isolated groups of human survivors settled down to an increasingly indolent tropical life.
	The fruits of past learning were not imparted to the young, who therefore grew up in extreme ignorance of almost everything beyond their immediate experience.
	At the same time the elder generation cowed their juniors with vague suggestions of racial defeat and universal futility.
	This would not have mattered, had the young themselves been normal; they would have reacted with fervent optimism.
	But they themselves were now by nature incapable of any enthusiasm.
	For, in a species in which the lower functions were so strictly disciplined under the higher, the long-drawn-out spiritual disaster had actually begun to take effect upon the germ-plasm; so that individuals were doomed before birth to lassitude, and to mentality in a minor key.
	The First Men, long ago, had fallen into a kind of racial senility through a combination of vulgar errors and indulgences.
	But the second species, like a boy whose mind has been too soon burdened with grave experience, lived henceforth in a sleep-walk.
</p>
<p>
	As the generations passed, all the lore of civilization was shed, save the routine of tropical agriculture and hunting.
	Not that intelligence itself had waned.
	Not that the race had sunk into mere savagery.
	Lassitude did not prevent it from readjusting itself to suit its new circumstances.
	These sleep-walkers soon invented convenient ways of making, in the home and by hand, much that had hitherto been made in factories and by mechanical power.
	Almost without mental effort they designed and fashioned tolerable instruments out of wood and flint and bone.
	But though still intelligent, they had become by disposition, supine, indifferent.
	They would exert themselves only under the pressure of urgent primitive need.
	No man seemed capable of putting forth the full energy of a man.
	Even suffering had lost its poignancy.
	And no ends seemed worth pursuing that could not be realized speedily.
	The sting had gone out of experience.
	The soul was calloused against every goad.
	Men and women worked and played, loved and suffered; but always in a kind of rapt absentmindedness.
	It was as though they were ever trying to remember something important which escaped them.
	The affairs of daily life seenicd too trivial to be taken seriously.
	Yet that other, and supremely important thing, which alone deserved consideration, was so obscure that no one had any idea what it was.
	Nor indeed was anyone aware of this hypnotic subjection, any more than a sleeper is aware of being asleep.
</p>
<p>
	The minimum of necessary work was performed, and there was even a dreamy zest in the performance, but nothing which would entail extra toil ever seemed worth while.
	And so, when adjustment to the new circumstances of the world had been achieved, complete stagnation set in.
	Practical intelligence was easily able to cope with a slowly changing environment, and even with sudden natural upheavals such as floods, earthquakes and disease epidemics.
	Man remained in a sense master of his world, but he had no idea what to do with his mastery.
	It was everywhere assumed that the sane end of living was to spend as many days as possible in indolence, lying in the shade.
	Unfortunately human beings had, of course, many needs which were irksome if not appeased, and so a good deal of hard work had to be done.
	Hunger and thirst had to be satisfied.
	Other individuals besides oneself had to be cared for, since man was cursed with sympathy and with a sentiment for the welfare of his group.
	The only fully rational behaviour, it was thought, would be general suicide, but irrational impulses made this impossible.
	Beatific drugs offered a temporary heaven.
	But, far as the Second Men had fallen, they were still too clear-sighted to forget that such beatitude is outweighed by subsequent misery.
</p>
<p>
	Century by century, epoch by epoch, man glided on in this seemingly precarious, yet actually unshakable equilibrium.
	Nothing that happened to him could disturb his easy dominance over the beasts and over physical nature; nothing could shock him out of his racial sleep.
	Long-drawn-out climatic changes made desert, jungle and grassland fluctuate like the clouds.
	As the years advanced by millions, ordinary geological processes, greatly accentuated by the immense strains set up by the Patagonian upheaval, remodelled the surface of the planet.
	Continents were submerged, or lifted out of the sea, till presently there was little of the old configuration.
	And along with these geological changes went changes in the fauna and flora.
	The bacterium which had almost exterminated man had also wrought havoc amongst other mammals.
	Once more the planet had to be re-stocked, this time from the few surviving tropical species.
	Once more there was a great remaking of old types, only less revolutionary than that which had followed the Patagonian disaster.
	And since the human race remained minute, through the effects of its spiritual fatigue, other species were favoured.
	Especially the ruminants and the large carnivora increased and diversified themselves into many habits and forms.

<p>
	But the most remarkable of all the biological trains of events in this period was the history of the Martian subvital units that had been disseminated by the slaughter of the Martian colony, and had then tormented men and animals with pulmonary diseases.
	As the ages passed, certain species of mammals so readjusted themselves that the Martian virus became not only harmless but necessary to their well-being.
	A relationship which was originally that of parasite and host became in time a true symbiosis, a co-operative partnership, in which the terrestrial animals gained something of the unique attributes of the vanished Martian organisms.
	The time was to come when Man himself should look with envy on these creatures, and finally make use of the Martian “virus” for his own enrichment.
</p>
<p>
	But meanwhile, and for many million years, almost all kinds of life were on the move, save Man.
	Like a ship-wrecked sailor, he lay exhausted and asleep on his raft, long after the storm had abated.
</p>
<p>
	But his stagnation was not absolute.
	Imperceptibly, he was drifting on the oceanic currents of life, and in a direction far out of his original course.
	Little by little, his habit was becoming simpler, less artificial, more animal.
	Agriculture faded out, since it was no longer necessary in the luxuriant garden where man lived.
	Weapons of defence and of the chase became more precisely adapted to their restricted purposes, but at the same time less diversified and more stereotyped.
	Speech almost vanished; for there was no novelty left in experience.
	Familiar facts and familiar emotions were conveyed increasingly by gestures which were mostly unwitting.
	Physically, the species had changed little.
	Though the natural period of life was greatly reduced, this was due less to physiological change than to a strange and fatal increase of absent-mindedness in middle-age.
	The individual gradually ceased to react to his environment; so that even if he escaped a violent death, he died of starvation.
</p>
<p>
	Yet in spite of this great change, the species remained essentially human.
	There was no bestialization, such as had formerly produced a race of sub-men.
	These tranced remnants of the second human species were not beasts but innocents, simples, children of nature, perfectly adjusted to their simple life.
	In many ways their state was idyllic and enviable.
	But such was their dimmed mentality that they were never clearly aware even of the blessings they had, still less, of course, of the loftier experiences which had kindled and tortured their ancestors.
